# EZGradeCalc
EZGradeCalc is designed to make it simple for students to be able to keep track of their school progress. Students are not only able to keep track of their class averages, but they are also able to keep track of their cumulative GPA. The option of choosing from multiple different themes allows for students to have some personal customization within the app.

## Technical Description
EZGradeCalc is an iOS application made in SwiftUI. The app contains a grading calculator and a GPA calculator, as well as the ability to select between several in-app theme color options. The use of core data allows for data persistence throughout the use of the application, so users never have to worry about re-entering the same information multiple times.
